# Website - A Hedge-Ops DevOps Project

This project is inspired by Hedge-Ops. The full blog post can be found here: [DevOps Project](http://hedge-ops.com/devops-project/).

## Phase 1: Simple Website
1. Create an account on https://github.com/
2. Create a repository named ```website``` on Github
3. Clone your ```website``` repository locally using your terminal (Terminal on a mac or PowerShell on windows).
4. Create a branch called ```feature_index```
5. Add an ```index.html``` to the branch that says ```Hello, World!``` in the text. You’ll want to make the change with Visual Studio Code
6. Check that in
7. Create a pull request for your branch to be merged into ```master```
8. Merge your pull request into ```master``` after it’s approved

## Phase 2 - Simple Webserver
